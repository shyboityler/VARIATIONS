        <h1>Relativity</h1>

        <h2>by Sarah Howe for Stephen Hawking</h2>
        <p>
        When we wake up brushed by panic in the dark<br>
        our pupils grope for the shape of things we know.<br><br><!-- <br> tag move the following content to the begeinning of the next line, putting another one of these tag will simply repeat the action-->

        Photons loosed from slits like greyhounds at the track<br>
        reveal light’s doubleness in their cast shadows<br><br>

        that stripe a dimmed lab’s wall—particles no more—<br>
        and with a wave bid all certainties goodbye.<br><br>

        For what’s sure in a universe that dopplers<br>
        away like a siren’s midnight cry? They say<br><br>

        a flash seen from on and off a hurtling train<br>
        will explain why time dilates like a perfect<br><br>

        afternoon; predicts black holes where parallel lines<br>
        will meet, whose stark horizon even starlight,<br><br>

        bent in its tracks, can’t resist. If we can think<br>
        this far, might not our eyes adjust to the dark?</p><br>
