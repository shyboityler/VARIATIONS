        When we wake up brushed by panic in the dark<br>
        our pupils grope for the shape of things we know.<br><br></h3>

        <h3>

        <h4>
        that stripe a dimmed lab’s wall—particles no more—<br>

        afternoon; predicts black holes where parallel lines<br>
        will meet, whose stark horizon even starlight,<br><br></h5>

        bent in its tracks, can’t resist. If we can think<br>
        this far, might not our eyes adjust to the dark?<br></h6>
