        <h1>Relativity</h1>

        <h2>by Sarah Howe for Stephen Hawking</h2>
        <p>
        When we wake up brushed<br>
        by panic in the dark<br><br>

        our pupils grope<br>
        for the shape of things we know.<br><br>

        Photons loosed from slits<br>
        like greyhounds at the track<br>
        reveal light’s doubleness<br>
        in their cast shadows<br><br>

        that stripe a dimmed lab’s wall<br>
        —particles no more—<br>
        and with a wave<br>
        bid all certainties goodbye.<br><br>

        For what’s sure in a universe<br>
        that dopplers away like a siren’s midnight cry?<br>
        They say<br><br>

        a flash<br>
        seen from on and off a hurtling train<br>
        will explain why time<br>
        dilates like a perfect<br><br>

        afternoon; predicts black holes where parallel lines<br>
        will meet, whose stark horizon even starlight,<br><br>

        bent in its tracks, can’t resist. If we can think<br>
        this far, might not our eyes<br>
        adjust to the dark?</p><br>
