        <h2>by Sarah Howe for Stephen Hawking</h2>
        <p>
        When we wake up brushed by panic in the dark,<br>
        our pupils grope for the shape of things we know.<br><br>

        Photons loosed from slits<br>
        like greyhounds at the track<br>
        reveal light’s doubleness in their cast shadows that stripe a dimmed lab’s wall.<br><br>

        —particles no more—<br>
        and with a wave<br>
        bid all certainties goodbye.<br><br>

        For what’s sure in a universe<br>
        that dopplers away like a siren’s midnight cry?<br><br>

        They say<br>
        a flash seen from on and off a hurtling train<br>
        will explain why time dilates like a perfect afternoon; <br>
        predicts black holes where parallel lines will meet, <br>
        whose stark horizon, even starlight, bent in its tracks, can’t resist. <br><br>

        If we can think this far, might not our eyes adjust to the dark?</p><br>
